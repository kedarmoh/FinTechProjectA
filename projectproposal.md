## Project Description 

What are we tring to do?

A program that allows an individul to select stocks they are are interested in, based on sector, and provides a stack rank of those stock based on different ratios and indicators (growth, liquidity, leverage, etc.)

How?

Our program would first propose a "Sector" prompt with 1-5 sectors in the dropdown. TBD.
From there there would be a list (static?) of companies to select from (this would ensure an apples to apples comparison for the stock analysis)
The user could select from up to 5 companies in that specific sector to be compared.
Our program would then take those five stocks, compute the ratios and indicators we have predetermined, set our proprietray weighting, and provide a stack rank of the stocks selected.

## Research Questions to Answer

For an individual interested in stocks: what stock is the best place for me to park my money, based on my sector interest?

## Datasets/Technologies to be Used 
Datasets: we'll use free/public financial APIs to pull historical data on the various stocks within the sectors. 

Technologies: APIs, Pandas, Plotly/HvPlot
